Mod that adds custom music to Minecraft.
Needs Architectury API in order to work.
Due to copyright/ownership reasons Soundtracks are not included and needed to be installed manually (See /src/main/resources/assets/triggermusic/sounds.json for needed OSTs or Content.odt).
The Soundtracks need to be placed in /src/main/resources/assets/triggermusic/sounds.
