Mod that adds custom music to Minecraft.

Needs Architectury API in order to work.

Due to copyright/ownership reasons Soundtracks are not included and needed to be installed manually (See /src/main/resources/assets/triggermusic/sounds.json for needed OSTs or Content.odt).
For the same reason i can not provide a compiled .jar, you will need to compile the source code yourself.

The Soundtracks need to be placed in /src/main/resources/assets/triggermusic/sounds.
